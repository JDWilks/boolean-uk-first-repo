    <p>
      Bluestone is currently moored in Berkhamsted due to lockdown although
      would normally be in continuous cruising mode ⛵️

    <p>
      Wood burners are an essential item for any narrow boat in the UK due it
      being bloody freezing ❄️

    <h1 class="secondH1">About Jonathon</h1>

    <p>
      Jonathon ran a successful music agency which he built from the ground up.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a while... the job was tough, babysitting drunk adults just didn't
      cut it anymore!
    </p>
    <p>
      So he sought a new life... a life of meaning... a life as a software developer.
